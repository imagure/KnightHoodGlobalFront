      Hello everyone, and welcome to the unofficial Knighthood Leaderboard website.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With this website, we intend to have a place where we can compete in all aspects of this loved game of ours, and have fun as a community.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We are adding new leaderboards as we find time and ideas. So if there is something you think it would be nice to be seen in here, please let us know.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      When submiting a guild boss picture, please be sure to get a image from you in game guild leaderboar. In this way, we can garantee that we are registering the score in the right Boss, and to the right player.
